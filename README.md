# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was created to create an online work day scheduler with input and time tracker.

## Installation

Installation is not required. The webpage is accessible from any web browser application.

## Usage

To use this service simply navigate to the website address below.

https://ahelmin.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

To use the word day scheduler, simply put your task in the text box in which your task is to be completed as seen in the screenshot below. The current time will be tracked and updated as you refresh the page. Grey boxes mean that it is an old task overdue, the orange means that is the current hour and the task is due, and the green color means that it is a future event.

After your task has been entered into the text box click on the save button as seen below in the image. You will see a message under the date at the top that the task was saved. This task will be saved even if you refresh your browser window. To erase a task delete the text in the hour block and save the empty block and it will be gone until you save another task in that block.
